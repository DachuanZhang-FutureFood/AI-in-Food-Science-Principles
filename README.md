# AI in Food Science Principles

This repository summarizes and contextualizes a **perspective on how artificial intelligence should be responsibly and effectively applied in food science**, based on a recent article published in *Trends in Food Science & Technology*.

Rather than focusing on specific algorithms, this work emphasizes **principles, evaluation, and infrastructure** required to advance AI in food science toward real scientific and societal impact.

## Why AI in Food Science Needs a Rethink

Artificial intelligence has been widely applied across food science, including nutrition, food safety, flavor, and sustainability.  
However, many current AI applications in food science remain **fragmented, poorly validated, and difficult to reproduce**.

Key limitations repeatedly observed in the field include:

- Limited integration of **domain knowledge**
- Small, fragmented, and biased datasets
- Lack of transparent and reproducible workflows
- Weak benchmarking and unfair model comparison
- Minimal experimental or real-world validation

As a result, many AI models demonstrate promising performance on paper but fail to translate into **reusable tools or practical applications**.

## Core Message

> **AI will not advance food science by scale alone.  
> Progress requires domain-aware models, just evaluation, and robust data standards.**

This perspective argues that food science presents **unique challenges** for AI, as food systems involve complex molecular interactions, processing effects, regulatory constraints, and cultural contexts that cannot be captured by generic models alone.

## Five Key Initiatives for Advancing AI in Food Science

The article proposes **five strategic initiatives** that should guide future AI research and applications in food science.

### 1. Deep Integration of Domain Knowledge

AI models in food science must incorporate:

- Food chemistry and matrix effects  
- Processing-induced molecular transformations  
- Safety, nutrition, and sustainability constraints  
- Cultural and regional food contexts  

Without domain knowledge, AI risks producing results that are statistically valid but scientifically or practically meaningless.

---

### 2. Transparency, Reusability, and Just Evaluation

A large proportion of published food AI models:

- Are not open source  
- Lack accessible data or code  
- Are not experimentally validated  

This perspective highlights the need for **open science practices**, fair benchmarking, and rigorous comparison against prior work to ensure meaningful progress.

---

### 3. Benchmarking and Community Evaluation

Unlike fields such as protein structure prediction (e.g., CASP), food science lacks:

- Gold-standard benchmark datasets  
- Community-driven evaluation initiatives  

Establishing shared benchmarks is essential to distinguish real methodological advances from incremental or redundant studies.

---

### 4. Practical and Experimental Validation

Model performance alone is insufficient.  
AI models should be validated through:

- Laboratory experiments  
- Independent datasets  
- Real-world or industrial use cases  

Validation bridges the gap between **computational promise and real food systems**.

---

### 5. Robust Data Standards and Infrastructure

Food science lacks widely adopted data infrastructures comparable to PubChem or UniProt.

Challenges include:

- Restricted access to food databases  
- Inconsistent metadata and reporting standards  
- Geographic and cultural biases in available data  

The perspective calls for **robust data standards, interoperable formats, and shared infrastructure** to support scalable and reliable AI development.

## Who Is This For?

- Food scientists applying AI or machine learning  
- AI researchers entering food-related problems  
- Graduate students seeking methodological guidance  
- Funding agencies and policy-oriented researchers  

This repository is intended as a **conceptual and methodological reference**, not a codebase.
